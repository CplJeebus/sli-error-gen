# SLI Error Gen

Silly script to create error data for sample SLI\SLO graphs. Basic idea is that it will emit as either json or csv output, A set of errors over 180 days. Each error object is a date and number of error mins burned to that date.

## Todo

- Get output working as a csv and json
- Create Fast Burn _Bart Simpson_ event(s)
- Create Slow Burn events. 
- Parameterise all of it.
- Add graphing function. 
- In addition to the running tally of mins burn should include errors burned that day.
